            <h4>Talk</h4>
            <p>
              Do you keep repeating unhealthy patterns even though you know better?
              Is your marriage in trouble?
              Is it hard to turn your brain off at night so you can’t sleep?
              Does your mood affect your work?
              Is a recent change in your life causing a lot of stress and anxiety?
            </p>
            <h5>Self-discovery with a purpose</h5>
            <p>
              We live in a world where it’s easier than ever to exchange information —
              but it’s rare to communicate in a deep and meaningful way.
              Therapy gives you the time, space, and freedom to address the issues
              that keep you from leading a life worth celebrating.
            </p>
            <h5>Understanding the problem so you can change your life</h5>
            <p>
              Many people who come to therapy know what they need to change,
              but they keep falling back into the same behaviors.
              Therapy can help you get over that emotional hurdle and make a meaningful,
              long-term difference in your life.
            </p>
            <h5>A challenging journey with a worthwhile destination</h5>
            <p>
              Maybe you think that talking about your problems will only make them worse
              — or that it’s just a waste time. You should know that therapy isn’t
              about wallowing in your problems. It always has a goal.
              It can bring about the changes in outlook, attitude and behavior
              that can make your life richer, your relationships more loving,
              and your work more fulfilling.
            </p>

              I will explain the therapeutic process and you can find out exactly
              what therapy can do for you.

          <h5>Invest in yourself</h5>
          <p>So much of our time and energy is devoted to others that we often neglect our own emotional health. Therapy is a way to invest in yourself — so you can invest more of yourself in your work, your family, and your relationships. It allows you to unplug from the constant demands and noise of your life to focus on overcoming the past, taking control of the present, and redefining the future.</p>
          <h5>Therapy works</h5>
          <p>You can change your life. That’s a truth we tend to forget — especially if the challenges you face have been years in the making. Study after study has shown that people who go to therapy see the results. Therapy isn’t a way out of your problems, but a way through. It’s a challenging process that demands a lot from you but offers a lot in return.</p>
          <h5>Are you ready to make a change for the better?</h5>
          <p>You’ve come to the right place. Schedule a <a href="#">thirty-minute consultation</a>.</p>

          <section class=content>
            <h5>Services and Rates:</h5>
            <p>Therapy is an investment of time and money. Rarely does anyone feel they have extra money to spend on personal growth. And yet, the cost of suffering individually or as a couple is a real expense out of your pocket. Missed time at work, poor job performance,
            inattention to financial details or personal spending, using drugs and alcohol, overeating, shopping to fill the void and many other costly behaviors are symptoms of stress, depression or anxiety. These behaviors over the long-term are often more expensive
            than the short-term investment of therapy. The average cost of divorce in the United States is roughly $15,000. Therapy is a bargain compared to divorce. Individual or couples therapy is an investment that can provide relief that actually improves your
            financial life — along with the rest of it. </p>
            <h5>Thirty-minute consultation: FREE</h5>
            <p>I encourage you to book a complimentary thirty minute in-office consultation. We’ll talk briefly about the problems you’re facing, the results you’d like to see, and whether
            we would work well together.
            <h5>Individual psychotherapy and counseling <br>
            Fifty-minute session: $120.00</h5> The majority of my clients attend individual counseling once or twice a week. Counseling is most effective on a weekly basis. I tell my clients their money
            is better invested in meeting once a week for six months rather than every other week for a year. Meeting less than once a week is considered “supportive” psychotherapy. Supportive psychotherapy can help you maintain the progress you’ve already accomplished.
            You may be able to be reimbursed for part of your sessions through your health insurance or flex spending plan, or both, making the therapy very affordable, if not completely covered. It’s up to clients to investigate this option through their employer’s
            health insurance. Also, psychotherapy is a medical deduction and tax write off.
            <h5>Couples counseling Fifty-five minute session: $150.00</h5>
            Most couples are already in crisis by the time they reach my office, and therapy is often a “last ditch” effort before
            the relationship ends. Often, one person wants to come to therapy and the other doesn’t. Some couples think I’m going to point a finger at one person as being the “bad” or problem partner. As an experienced couples counselor, I am trained and ready for
            these dynamics. I know how hard it is to come to couples therapy. I make sure that it feels safe and supportive for both partners. I don’t take sides, and I’m not interested in placing blame. My job is to help clients identify their individual and shared
            dynamics, own their part of the problem, communicate safely, and move toward being more loving and empathic. I can help with common relationship issues such as: Fighting and painful arguments Silence and withdrawal Betrayal, affairs, and exiting the relationship
            Feeling like roommates Relationship boredom Sexual disconnection Parenting disputes Boundaries with friends and family Couples counseling is very hard work —for the couple and the therapist. I make it comfortable, safe, and even funny at times. A little
            humor never hurts! I recommend one or two weekly sessions. Be prepared to work hard in and out of session to make progress toward your goals.
            <h5>Supervision and consultation to training or licensed therapists Call for fee </h5>
            As an experienced senior therapist I provide consultation on clinical cases.
            <h5>Payment</h5>
            Cash, check and credit card are accepted for payment.
            <h5>Insurance</h5>
            You may need to call your insurance company to find out of if “out-of-network” mental health benefits are available after your deductible.
            Psychotherapy may be reimbursable through Flexible Spending plans, cafeteria plans or HSAs.
            <h5>Cancellation Policy</h5> If you do not show up for your scheduled therapy appointment and you have not notified me at least one full business day in advance, you will
            be required to pay the full cost of the session.

            <h4>First Visit: What to Expect</h4>
            <p>
              When you take advantage of my free 30 minute consultation,
              you will find it to be a friendly, casual and relaxing experience.
              Often new clients are nervous or anxious before we meet.
              That’s normal. My job is to put you at ease and help you feel comfortable.
              The free consultation gives you a chance to meet me,
              see my office space and talk briefly about your goals for your therapy.
              Most people wait a long time before making their first appointment
              and it’s a relief to finally get started. My goal is that you feel safe
              and positive about our first meeting. All you have to do is show up and be yourself.
            </p>
