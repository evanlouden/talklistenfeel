                  We live in a world where it’s easier than ever to exchange information — but it’s rare to communicate in a deep and meaningful way. Therapy gives you the time, space, and freedom to address the issues that keep you from leading a life worth celebrating.

                  and behavior that can make your life richer, your relationships more loving, and your work more fulfilling.

                  Therapy is more than a conversation. It’s a collaboration between you and your therapist — one where the therapist listens you in a fundamentally different way than you’ll encounter in the other relationships in your everyday life. Therapists are trained
                  to listen for the patterns, themes, and dynamics underlying what you say. Think about when you read a novel. On one level, you read for the story – to find out what happens next. But you can also pay attention to the themes, the metaphors,
                  and the author’s style and how these things provide new insight on the story itself. That’s similar to what a therapist does.

                  How do you feel? It’s a simple enough question. But for many of us, it can be hard to answer. When you take the time to discover what you actually feel – and why you feel that way – you’re on the way to correcting the negative thinking, behaviors, and
                  patterns that prevent you from living the life you want. You can start to make the changes you want to make because you have a clear, realistic understanding of who you are who you want to be.

                  I like to call my brand of therapy “classic.” That doesn’t mean it’s stuck in the past or that it ignores the pressures and stresses of modern life. Instead, it offers an antidote to those pressures by allowing you the time and freedom to express yourself
                  and to listen to the inner voice that’s demanding your attention. Feelings are the best tool we have for managing personal issues, healing old patterns, and feeling alive again. If your emotional life is unhealthy, you’ll see the effects
                  in other areas of your life – the same way a physical illness can affect your work and your relationships.

          <h3>Invest in yourself</h3>
        </div>
        <p>So much of our time and energy is devoted to others that we often neglect our own emotional health. Therapy is a way to invest in yourself — so you can invest more of yourself in your work, your family, and your relationships. It allows you to unplug
          from the constant demands and noise of your life to focus on overcoming the past, taking control of the present, and redefining the future.</p>
        <h4>Therapy works</h4>
        <p>You can change your life. That’s a truth we tend to forget — especially if the challenges you face have been years in the making. Study after study has shown that people who go to therapy see the results. Therapy isn’t a way out of your problems,
          but a way through. It’s a challenging process that demands a lot from you but offers a lot in return.</p>

        <p>Therapy is an investment of time and money. Rarely does anyone feel they have extra money to spend on personal growth. And yet, the cost of suffering individually or as a couple is a real expense out of your pocket. Missed time at work, poor job performance,
          inattention to financial details or personal spending, using drugs and alcohol, overeating, shopping to fill the void and many other costly behaviors are symptoms of stress, depression or anxiety. These behaviors over the long-term are often more
          expensive than the short-term investment of therapy. The average cost of divorce in the United States is roughly $15,000. Therapy is a bargain compared to divorce. Individual or couples therapy is an investment that can provide relief that actually
          improves your financial life — along with the rest of it. </p>
        <h4>Thirty-minute consultation: FREE</h4>
        <p>I encourage you to book a complimentary thirty minute in-office consultation. We’ll talk briefly about the problems you’re facing, the results you’d like to see, and whether we would work well together.
          <h4>Individual psychotherapy and counseling <br>
              Fifty-minute session: $120.00</h4> The majority of my clients attend individual counseling once or twice a week. Counseling is most effective on a weekly basis. I tell my clients their money is better invested in meeting once a week for six months rather than every other week for
          a year. Meeting less than once a week is considered “supportive” psychotherapy. Supportive psychotherapy can help you maintain the progress you’ve already accomplished. You may be able to be reimbursed for part of your sessions through your health
          insurance or flex spending plan, or both, making the therapy very affordable, if not completely covered. It’s up to clients to investigate this option through their employer’s health insurance. Also, psychotherapy is a medical deduction and tax
          write off.
          <h4>Couples counseling Fifty-five minute session: $150.00</h4> Most couples are already in crisis by the time they reach my office, and therapy is often a “last ditch” effort before the relationship ends. Often, one person wants to come to therapy and the other doesn’t. Some couples think I’m going to point
          a finger at one person as being the “bad” or problem partner. As an experienced couples counselor, I am trained and ready for these dynamics. I know how hard it is to come to couples therapy. I make sure that it feels safe and supportive for both
          partners. I don’t take sides, and I’m not interested in placing blame. My job is to help clients identify their individual and shared dynamics, own their part of the problem, communicate safely, and move toward being more loving and empathic. I
          can help with common relationship issues such as: Fighting and painful arguments Silence and withdrawal Betrayal, affairs, and exiting the relationship Feeling like roommates Relationship boredom Sexual disconnection Parenting disputes Boundaries
          with friends and family Couples counseling is very hard work —for the couple and the therapist. I make it comfortable, safe, and even funny at times. A little humor never hurts! I recommend one or two weekly sessions. Be prepared to work hard in
          and out of session to make progress toward your goals.
          <h4>Supervision and consultation to training or licensed therapists Call for fee </h4> As an experienced senior therapist I provide consultation on clinical cases.
          <h4>Payment</h4> Cash, check and credit card are accepted for payment.
          <h4>Insurance</h4> You may need to call your insurance company to find out of if “out-of-network” mental health benefits are available after your deductible. Psychotherapy may be reimbursable through Flexible Spending plans, cafeteria plans or HSAs.
          <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4> If you do not show up for your scheduled therapy appointment and you have not notified me at least one full business day in advance, you will be required to pay the full cost of the session.
          <h4>Schedule Online</h4> Request a therapy appointment online here. Contact Questions? Please contact me for further information.

        <p>
          When you take advantage of my free 30 minute consultation, you will find it to be a friendly, casual and relaxing experience. Often new clients are nervous or anxious before we meet. That’s normal. My job is to put you at ease and help you feel comfortable.
          The free consultation gives you a chance to meet me, see my office space and talk briefly about your goals for your therapy. Most people wait a long time before making their first appointment and it’s a relief to finally get started. My goal is
          that you feel safe and positive about our first meeting. All you have to do is show up and be yourself.
